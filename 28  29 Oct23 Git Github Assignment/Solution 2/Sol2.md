# Git Workflow Explanation

## Working Directory
The working directory is the local file system where you create, modify, and organize your project files. It contains the current state of your project, including any changes you have made.

## Staging Area
The staging area, also known as the index, acts as a middle-ground between your working directory and the Git repository. It allows you to selectively choose which changes you want to include in the next commit. Before a commit, you stage the changes you want to be part of the snapshot.

## Repository
The Git repository is the database that stores the project's history and all the changes made over time. It consists of a series of commits, each representing a specific state of the project. The repository is typically located in a hidden folder named `.git` at the root of your project.

# Git Workflow Steps

1. **Initialize a Repository:**
   - Use `git init` to start a new Git repository in your project directory.

2. **Add Files to the Repository:**
   - Use `git add <filename>` to stage specific files or `git add .` to stage all changes in the working directory.

3. **Commit Changes:**
   - Use `git commit -m "Commit message"` to create a snapshot of the staged changes. The commit message should describe the purpose of the commit.

4. **View History:**
   - Use `git log` to see a history of commits, including commit messages, authors, and timestamps.

5. **Create Branches:**
   - Use `git branch <branch-name>` to create a new branch.
   - Use `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch to a different branch.

6. **Merge Changes:**
   - Use `git merge <branch-name>` to integrate changes from one branch into another.

7. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - If there are conflicting changes during a merge, resolve them manually and then commit the resolved changes.

8. **Push to Remote Repository:**
   - Use `git push` to push local changes to a remote repository, making them accessible to collaborators.

9. **Pull from Remote Repository:**
   - Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local branch.

10. **Clone a Repository:**
    - Use `git clone <repository-url>` to create a local copy of a remote repository.

# Question 4:  What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword?  

## Purpose of Declaring Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. They allow developers to assign a name (identifier) to a value, making it easier to reference and manipulate that value throughout the code. Declaring variables is a fundamental concept in programming, enabling the creation of dynamic and adaptable scripts.

## Declaration with `let` Keyword
In JavaScript, the `let` keyword is commonly used to declare variables. Here's a simple syntax example:

```javascript
let variableName = value;
```

### Example:
```javascript

let message = "Hello, World!";
let count = 42;
let isTrue = true;
```

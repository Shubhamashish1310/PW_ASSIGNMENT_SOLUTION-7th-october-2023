# Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript. 

# Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript has five primitive data types, which are the most basic building blocks for storing and manipulating data.

## 1. **String:**
   - Represents sequences of characters.
   - Example: `"Hello, World!"`

## 2. **Number:**
   - Represents numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
   - Example: `42` or `3.14`

## 3. **Boolean:**
   - Represents a logical value indicating `true` or `false`.
   - Example: `true`

## 4. **Null:**
   - Represents the absence of any object value.
   - Example: `null`

## 5. **Undefined:**
   - Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - Example: `undefined`

These primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are assigned. They serve as the foundation for more complex data structures and operations in JavaScript.

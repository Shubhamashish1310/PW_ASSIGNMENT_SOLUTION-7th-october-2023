# Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where you would use each.  

# JavaScript vs. HTML

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic features to websites. It runs in the browser and allows developers to manipulate webpage content, handle user interactions, and perform actions based on events.

### Example:
```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello, World!')">Click me</button> 
```

### Use Cases
#### JavaScript:
- Form validation
- Creating interactive sliders or carousels
Fetching data from a server asynchronously


## HTML
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that structures the content of a webpage. It defines the elements and layout of a page, such as headings, paragraphs, and images.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
  <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Use Cases
#### HTML:
- Defining the structure of a webpage
- Presenting text, images, and multimedia
- Creating links and navigation elements

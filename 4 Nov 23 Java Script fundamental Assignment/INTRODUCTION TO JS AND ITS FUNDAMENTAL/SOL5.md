# Importance of Comments in JavaScript

Comments in JavaScript serve as annotations within the code, providing additional information for developers. They are essential for clarity, documentation, and collaboration.

## Single-Line Comment
Single-line comments are used for brief explanations on a single line.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let BMI = weight * height*height; // Calculating total BMI
```

## Multi-Line Comment
- Multi-line comments are suitable for more extensive explanations or commenting out multiple lines of code.

```javascript

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It provides detailed information about the purpose or functionality of the code.
  
  Example:
  Performing a series of operations to process user input.
*/

let result = processInput(userInput);
```
Comments enhance code readability, make it easier for others to understand your code, and help you remember the purpose of specific sections. However, it's crucial to maintain concise and relevant comments to avoid clutter.
